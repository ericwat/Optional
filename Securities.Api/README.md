# Securities API

This is a simple API built with C# and .NET 8.0, designed to provide information about securities.

## Features

- Get a list of securities
- Get information about a specific security

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

- `Securities.Api`: This is where the main application resides. It contains the `Program.cs` file which is the entry point of the application, and the `Endpoints.cs` file which contains the endpoint configurations.
- `Securities.Lib`: This is a library that contains the `ISecuritiesService.cs` files. The `ISecuritiesService.cs` file defines the `ISecuritiesService` interface which is used to fetch securities data.

## Setup

To run this project, you need to have .NET 8.0 SDK installed on your machine. Once you have that, you can clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

Run the following command to start the application:

```bash
dotnet run --project Securities.Api
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /securities`: Returns a list of all securities.
- `GET /security/{ticker}`: Returns information about a specific security.

## Development

This project is developed using JetBrains Rider 2024.1 RC 1. The `.gitignore` file is configured to ignore files generated by Rider.
